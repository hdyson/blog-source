* The problem

Publishing posts via hugo is slightly more manual than I'd like.  Can we automate this with Github actions?

* Background

The setup for the initial deployment was described in 
[[{{< ref "/posts/deploying-to-github-pages" >}}][this post]].

For adding a new post or amendments to a post, the procedure is:

1. Run the ~deploy.sh~ script.
2. Commit and push the changes to the source repo.
3. ~cd~ to ~public~ directory in source repo.
4. ~git push~ to push to the built site repo.

Can steps 3 and 4 be automated away with [[https://github.com/features/actions][Github actions]]?  I don't think we can
simplify the other steps - since they are run locally, I'm not sure the remote
github repository can replace them.
