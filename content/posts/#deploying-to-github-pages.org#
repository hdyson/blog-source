Deploying Hugo generated site to [[https://pages.github.com/][Github pages]] (and hence [[https://hdyson.dev][hdyson.dev]]) via the instructions from the [[https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/][Hugo docs]].

To summarise:

1. [[https://github.com/new][Create]] source and ~<username>.github.io~ (for the built version) repos on Github.
