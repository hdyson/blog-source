A quick summary of deploying Hugo this generated site to [[https://pages.github.com/][Github pages]] (and hence [[https://hdyson.dev][hdyson.dev]]) via the instructions from the [[https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/][Hugo docs]].

<!--more-->

To summarise:

1. [[https://github.com/new][Create]] source (arbitrary name) and deployed (name must be ~<username>.github.io~ for Github pages) repos on Github.
2. Clone the source project.  Note the ~baseURL~ in the config should point to the Github URL even when making the site available via a different URL.
3. Add content.
4. Add the built (by default, ~./public~) folder as a submodule, pointing to ~<username>.github.io~:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git submodule add -b master git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io.git public
    #+END_SRC
5. Add and run the [[https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script][deploy.sh]] script.
6. Finally, tweak the deployed repository settings as per the Github [[https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site][instructions]].
