* The problem

Publishing posts via hugo is slightly more manual than I'd like.  The trigger
for this post was "Can we automate this with [[https://github.com/features/actions][Github actions]]?", but it turns
out the solution was much simpler.

<!--more-->

* Background

The setup for the initial deployment was described in
[[{{< ref "/posts/deploying-to-github-pages" >}}][this post]].

For adding a new post or amendments to a post, the procedure is:

1. Run the ~deploy.sh~ script.
2. Commit and push the changes to the source repo.
3. ~cd~ to ~public~ directory in source repo.
4. ~git push~ to push to the built site repo.

My first throughs where whether we could automate steps 3 and 4 with [[https://github.com/features/actions][Github
actions]]?  But I think a better approach is to modify the ~deploy.sh~ script -
there's no need for anything after step 1 to be manual.

* Solution

After writing or amending a post, commit the changes locally and then run the
modified [[https://github.com/hdyson/blog-source/blob/master/deploy.sh][deploy.sh]].  The original version of the script came from the [[https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script][hugo
docs]]; the description and comments implies that the new behaviour is what was
intended for the script?  Either way, this version works for me now, while
previously I had to perform the extra steps.

* Update

It looks like the original script doesn't perform the git push stage if
there's nothing to commit - e.g. if the commit was done manually.  So it may
be that separating the push into two steps isn't necessary, but if it ain't
broke...
