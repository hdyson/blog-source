It's not obvious (to me, anyway) how to use [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/][hugo cross-reference links]] with
org-mode format posts.  This very short post gives an example of how to do so.

Here's an example for linking to this post:

[[{{< ref "/posts/post-links.org" >}}]]

#+BEGIN_SRC
[[{{</* ref "/posts/post-links.org" */>}}]]
#+END_SRC
The org-mode link syntax needs to be used in addition to the curly braces.
The use of ~/* ... */~ (which you'll only see if you're looking at the source
of this repo on github) to escape Hugo rendering the literal example is from
[[https://liatas.com/posts/escaping-hugo-shortcodes/][this post]].
